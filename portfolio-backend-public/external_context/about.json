    "journeyText": "After starting my tech journey in IT and network management roles in the IDF and the Tel Aviv Municipality, I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and dove into full-stack development. \n\nSelf-driven and always eager to learn, I transitioned to DevOps to bridge my passion for development and infrastructure. \n\nToday, I specialize in cloud automation, CI/CD, and infrastructure as code—designing robust solutions with tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, and AWS. I enjoy creative challenges, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and the systems I work with.",
